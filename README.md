# Auth Reports

### Auth Data in report form, in Auth, fully configurable

AKA Corp Stats 3.0

- Configurable Report Framework for corporate level aggregation of any data
- each "field" is a smart filter similar to secure groups ( can use secure groups filters too ) or a "field only" filter provided by any application in the alliance auth ecosystem.
  - These filters MUST be the more "modern" kind with either a `process_field` or `audit_filter` methods. Legacy filters using only `process_filter` will not show any data. [Please see this link for more info](https://github.com/Solar-Helix-Independent-Transport/allianceauth-secure-groups/blob/main/THRID_PARTY.md)
- Data Exportable to CSV for external manipulation.

## What it needs:

- require corporate member tokens to build the corp groups to see people not known to auth, to make a report for that too. these can be added with the pluss button in the menubar

## The General Road Map

if you want some features, please create an issue.

- state level report that shows all members of a state
- group reports for group leaders
- overview screen with passing/failing per corp per "report" ( maybe have this as optional aka "show_on_global_overview_report" )
- more things...

## Filters/stats provided by this app

- show all alts for a main, with option to only show in corp alts

## Permissions

There are some basic access perms

All permissions are filtered by main character, if a person has neutral alts loaded they will also be visible to someone who can see their main.
